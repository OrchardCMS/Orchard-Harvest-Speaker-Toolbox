# Orchard Harvest Speaker Toolbox

What you as a speaker at the Orchard Harvest conference need to give an awesome talk.

## How to prepare?

- If you're new to giving talks, check out the great guides below. And be sure to practice your talk sufficiently, especially that it fits into the allocated time.
  - [Watch this video](http://www.ted.com/talks/chris_anderson_teds_secret_to_great_public_speaking) by Chris Anderson (the curator of [TED](http://www.ted.com/)) about his insights and tips on giving a great public speech or presentation.

- Prefer live demos over slides.
- Set your screen resolution at most to full HD (1920×1080px). The recording will happen in this resolution too.
- The goal of each talk is to share knowledge with the community. So, please keep this in mind. It's fine to introduce what you do and your company (actually it's a good way to add some depth to your talk) but please don't make it into a commercial.
- If you need any help, just let us know by replying to the email you received from us. Most of the organizers are also speakers with dozens or even hundreds of talks behind them, so we know how it feels to be in your shoes. We're more than happy to coach you, including having rehearsal sessions.

## Presentation template

We have prepared a presentation template for you, see the repository root. You can use this if you don't know how to start, or if you'd like to match the event's design. However, if you're already using your own template, you don't need copy everything over if you don't want to.

Once we have the list of sponsors finalized, we'll ask you to please include their logos in your presentation; we'll get in touch about that.

## Checklist just before your talk

What to check just before you go on stage?

- Shut down Teams, Slack, OneDrive, etc. that can interfere in the background and that people can use to call you or write messages to you (we don't want private conversations to appear in a notification!).
- Disable night light/Flux, or anything that distorts the color of your screen.
- Mute your phone. You can use it to display a countdown for your allotted time.
- Open every software you'll use, build solutions, start Orchard Core instances, so you don't take time waiting for these to load.
- Clean up your desktop and taskbar to get rid of everything not necessary for the session. Even better you can use virtual desktops (a built-in feature with Windows 10 and later) for just presenting and if you make the taskbar hidden.
- If you have to do a lot of demos in a browser, then use Chrome's Guest mode. That way, your personal browser history and form auto-fill values won't be visible.
- When browsing around in Windows Explorer, not to show other folders and the “Quick access” menu that might contain private info, [hide the Navigation Pane](https://www.elevenforum.com/t/show-or-hide-navigation-pane-in-file-explorer-in-windows-11.2537/).
- If you show code, increase the font size of the code window to >130%.
